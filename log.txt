digging
temp power ups (ex: touch a wall, get triple-boost for 10 seconds)
obstacles that need double-boost to get past
minimap
Boomerang throw by out and back motion

powerups:
    explosion on boost
    triple-boost
    digging

skills to teach:
    wall hugging: move paralell to wall, then boost into it to just slide.
    out-and-back: go out to scout, then boost back for safety

    getting over a bump by first going to a back wall.
    need to go to the ceiling first!

fix bug: if rapidly to "right down" to just move one space, it can often lead to immediately right again probably due to the hold logic.
    solution: we should buffer the last edge only. so in this case, the last edge would be the down.
    this would still work in the "hit and move" case, since then, the right key would be the last edge.
