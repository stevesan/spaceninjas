redo controls so boost doesn't need "runway"

damage zones and heal zones
    can make time-sensitive traversal parts

force zones

charge-type enemies, ie. invulnerable unless you let them charge, then dodge, then hit behind.
    make the chaser do this.
    ie. chaser should follow until it has a clear LOS to player
    then telegraph 2s, then charge. chaser should have clear front-armor

hitscan enemy

puzzles where you draw out a line, like infinite snake
    could copy some Witness puzzles - heh! maybe with action elements
walls that bounce you off immediately...? not that interesting.
no-boost zones
    puzzles?
    could do single-boost-only puzzles with no-boost zones and a boost-OK hole

enemies with tails (head is harmful, but tail is vulnerable)

change size, ala. badland

like VVVVVV, with regular intra-level checkpoints.
metroid-vania, like RWK

csv level importer
    each csv cell has a word in it. word maps directly to game object name of prefab

digging
temp power ups (ex: touch a wall, get triple-boost for 10 seconds)
obstacles that need double-boost to get past
minimap
Boomerang throw by out and back motion

powerups:
    explosion on boost
    triple-boost
    digging

skills to teach: (for no-boost zone puzzles)
    wall hugging: move paralell to wall, then boost into it to just slide.
    out-and-back: go out to scout, then boost back for safety

    getting over a bump by first going to a back wall.
    need to go to the ceiling first!

    OOOOOOO
    O     L
    Op    L
    O     L
    OOO   L
    OOO   L
    O     L
    O     L
    O     L

    p = player, L = lava, 0 = rock

fix bug: if rapidly to "right down" to just move one space, it can often lead to immediately right again probably due to the hold logic.
    solution: we should buffer the last edge only. so in this case, the last edge would be the down.
    this would still work in the "hit and move" case, since then, the right key would be the last edge.
implement raycast to test
implement grab: ie. even if out of boosts, do a quick raycast in a direciton,
      if it hits a wall, then allow to stop right there.
    done, but not sure if i like it.

turret
combat - boost to attack?
