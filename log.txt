structure.
    metroidvania:
        examples:
            metroid
            SOTN
            VVVVVV
        pros:
            sense of exploring a place, immersive
            multiple fronts, so if player gets stuck, they can push somewhere else. and maybe that helps them (grinding in SOTN)
        cons:
            backtracking
            more planning (levels must work forward and backward; all areas must fit together;)
            'what next?' 
                some gates may be non-obvious to observe/open. such as, breaking the ice floor in SOTN. or the switch that opens red floors.
                Metroid Prime had some hints, ie. the map pings

    series of levels:
        examples:
            ecco the dolphin
            DOOM
            Deus Ex

        pros:
            easier to plan

        cons:
            if levels too small, less sense of exploration. but Ecco still succeeded
            unable to go back to levels to grind (without breaking immersion, like Goblin Sword)

    hub:
        examples: Demons' Souls, Mega Man
        pros:   
            less confusing, but still multi-front
            can be sense of cohesive space...but spokes may be too separate
        cons:
            less cohesive narrative progression. 

    GOALS FOR STRUCTURE:
        a sense that you're exploring a single, real space.
            good examples:
                Half-Life. Metroids. SOTN. Fallouts. Dark Souls. Shadow of the Colossus. Outcast.
                continuity seems pretty important. not necessarily backtracking..but maybe some.
                MGS3.
            bad examples:
                Demon's Souls - the hub spokes felt too independent from each other. contrast with Dark Souls.

        a sense of forward progression, towards the center/end
            good examples: The Room. Zelda.
                I guess to have a sense of progression towards something spatially, you need to first have an idea of where that thing is.
                For The Room, it was obvious: get the box to open. For zelda, the compass.

        sense of mystery and exploration    
            Good: Ecco, Half Life, Metroid
            i feel like the structure doesn't have much to do with this. it's more about tone, progression of content, etc. which can be done in any physical structure with gating.

        the ability to fill out a map, as long as it doesn't take too long
            Good: DOOM, Descent, Fallout.
            Not so great: Metroid Prime, SOTN. I think I was annoyed by the lack of info on the map. ie. if i knew that this unexplored part required double jump, then that's fine.

    NON GOALS:
         backtracking, open-world "do whatever you want"
         tons of secrets littered around

    STUFF I JUST DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT METROIDVANIAS:
        annoying backtracking. like in metroid prime, that part with all the colored robots that were mad annoying to fight. had to do it each time. but, other parts where you could run through were fun.
        not knowing what to do next
            SOTN: i got double jump, yay, now what? ok let's go to this gray spot on the map...oh it requires something ELSE. ugh ok next...
            i could keep my own notes. or the game could do it for me...or let me do it in-game with map notes.
            Metroid Prime: the door colors were helpful. still had some non-map info tho, like where you needed the ball and stuff. MAP NOTES!

locks and keys - knock a key around to get it to the door
or just buttons to open doors

TODO: platforms, ie. when you touch it, you start moving with it. could also rotate! especially for no-boost zones

environmental weapons:
    touch a thing, get ability to touch-attack once

checkpoints
levels and structure

corrosive zones and heal zones
    can make time-sensitive traversal parts

hugger: enemy that wraps around you. you have to get it off by touching lava.
    ala metroid

puzzles where you have to lead a smartbomb into an area. maybe multiple!

force zones
    need player interface to add forces...temporary and sustained

way of making sure enemies are in-view before they attack? for things like the bull

hitscan enemy? with laser sight

puzzles where you draw out a line, like infinite snake
    could copy some Witness puzzles - heh! maybe with action elements
walls that bounce you off immediately...? not that interesting.
no-boost zones
    puzzles?
    could do single-boost-only puzzles with no-boost zones and a boost-OK hole

enemies with snake-like tails (head is harmful, but tail is vulnerable)

change size, ala. badland

like VVVVVV, with regular intra-level checkpoints.
metroid-vania, like RWK

temp power ups (ex: touch a wall, get triple-boost for 10 seconds)
minimap
Boomerang throw by out and back motion

powerups:
    explosion on boost
    triple-boost
    digging

skills to teach: (for no-boost zone puzzles)
    wall hugging: move paralell to wall, then boost into it to just slide.
    out-and-back: go out to scout, then boost back for safety

    getting over a bump by first going to a back wall.
    need to go to the ceiling first!

    OOOOOOO
    O     L
    Op    L
    O     L
    OOO   L
    OOO   L
    O     L
    O     L
    O     L

    p = player, L = lava, 0 = rock

fix bug: if rapidly to "right down" to just move one space, it can often lead to immediately right again probably due to the hold logic.
    solution: we should buffer the last edge only. so in this case, the last edge would be the down.
    this would still work in the "hit and move" case, since then, the right key would be the last edge.
implement raycast to test
implement grab: ie. even if out of boosts, do a quick raycast in a direciton,
      if it hits a wall, then allow to stop right there.
    done, but not sure if i like it.

turret
combat - boost to attack?
DONE redo controls so boost doesn't need "runway"
DONE digging
DONE obstacles that need double-boost to get past
DONE charge-type enemies, ie. invulnerable unless you let them charge, then dodge, then hit behind.
    then telegraph 2s, then charge. chaser should have clear front-armor
    implemented BullMaster
DONE: Fix issue where if you hit a direction on the same frame as collision stopping you, you just stop
short term:
    done. this was caused by the rest frame, but also the physics stopping.
DONE: enemies explode into health pickups..
puzzle: instead of "one boost" zones, you could sort of do similar puzzles with rigidbodies you knock around.
    ie. if they hit lava, they get destroyed
    these are basically block puzzles.....
DONE SHORT TERM:
    ok, before we create a crazy level pipeline, let's actually just manually create a world first. manually. using some unity 2d editing plugin, or just some grid-based tools.
    so, let's just setup a quick pipeline for manual editing
