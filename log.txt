enemies explode into health pickups..

puzzle: instead of "one boost" zones, you could sort of do similar puzzles with rigidbodies you knock around.
    ie. if they hit lava, they get destroyed
    these are basically block puzzles.....

LONG TERM: need to have rapid, on-phone design iteration!! so, create system to download levels
    from internet, create levels using tiled. enemies...have 1 tile per rotation.
    we should probably *generate* the tilesets from the game build. and generate a .tmx file. (XML)
    1 tile per 90deg rotation for enemies
    keep it consistent via some UUID

checkpoints
levels and structure

locks and keys - knock a key around to get it to the door


corrosive zones and heal zones
    can make time-sensitive traversal parts

hugger: enemy that wraps around you. you have to get it off by touching lava.
    ala metroid

puzzles where you have to lead a smartbomb into an area. maybe multiple!

force zones
    need player interface to add forces...temporary and sustained

way of making sure enemies are in-view before they attack? for things like the bull

hitscan enemy? with laser sight

puzzles where you draw out a line, like infinite snake
    could copy some Witness puzzles - heh! maybe with action elements
walls that bounce you off immediately...? not that interesting.
no-boost zones
    puzzles?
    could do single-boost-only puzzles with no-boost zones and a boost-OK hole

enemies with snake-like tails (head is harmful, but tail is vulnerable)

change size, ala. badland

like VVVVVV, with regular intra-level checkpoints.
metroid-vania, like RWK

temp power ups (ex: touch a wall, get triple-boost for 10 seconds)
minimap
Boomerang throw by out and back motion

powerups:
    explosion on boost
    triple-boost
    digging

skills to teach: (for no-boost zone puzzles)
    wall hugging: move paralell to wall, then boost into it to just slide.
    out-and-back: go out to scout, then boost back for safety

    getting over a bump by first going to a back wall.
    need to go to the ceiling first!

    OOOOOOO
    O     L
    Op    L
    O     L
    OOO   L
    OOO   L
    O     L
    O     L
    O     L

    p = player, L = lava, 0 = rock

fix bug: if rapidly to "right down" to just move one space, it can often lead to immediately right again probably due to the hold logic.
    solution: we should buffer the last edge only. so in this case, the last edge would be the down.
    this would still work in the "hit and move" case, since then, the right key would be the last edge.
implement raycast to test
implement grab: ie. even if out of boosts, do a quick raycast in a direciton,
      if it hits a wall, then allow to stop right there.
    done, but not sure if i like it.

turret
combat - boost to attack?
DONE redo controls so boost doesn't need "runway"
DONE digging
DONE obstacles that need double-boost to get past
DONE charge-type enemies, ie. invulnerable unless you let them charge, then dodge, then hit behind.
    then telegraph 2s, then charge. chaser should have clear front-armor
    implemented BullMaster
DONE: Fix issue where if you hit a direction on the same frame as collision stopping you, you just stop
short term:
    done. this was caused by the rest frame, but also the physics stopping.
